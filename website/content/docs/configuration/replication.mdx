# `replication` Stanza

The `replication` stanza specifies various parameters for tuning replication related values.

```hcl
replication {
  resolver_discover_servers = true
  logshipper_buffer_length = 1000
  logshipper_buffer_size = "5gb"
	allow_forwarding_via_header = false
	best_effort_wal_wait_duration = "2s"
}
```

## `replication` Parameters

- `resolver_discover_servers` `(boolean: true)` - Indicates if the resolver should discover servers.
- `logshipper_buffer_length` `(integer: 0)` - The maximum number of entries that the log shipper buffer can hold.
- `logshipper_buffer_size` `(string: "")` - The maximum size that the log shipper buffer can be. This size can be
  expressed as an integer, indicating the number of bytes, or as a capacity string. Capacity strings are a number,
  followed by an optional space, followed by a suffix indicating the capacity. Valid suffixes are:
  `kb, kib, mb, mib, gb, gib, tb, tib`, which correspond to kilobytes, kibibytes, megabytes, mebibytes, etc. Full
  details on multiple-byte units in both powers of 2 and 10 can be found
  [on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte#Multiple-byte_units). The suffixes are not case-sensitive.
- `allow_forwarding_via_header` `(boolean: flase)` - Enable forwarding options for client controlled consistency,
  i.e. `X-Vault-Inconsistent: forward-active-node` and `X-Vault-Forward: active-node`.
- `best_effort_wal_wait_duration` `(duration: "2s")` - Legacy mitigation to try to prevent stale reads: when a
  write is made via RPC, i.e. the node handling the request didn't do the write itself, wait up to this much
  time to see the resulting WAL present locally before returning a response to the client.
